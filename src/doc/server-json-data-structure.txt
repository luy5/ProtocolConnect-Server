== Introduction ==
The web server communicates with mobile clients via a RESTful API.  All queries and
responses are in JSON formats.

== Source Code ==
The source code for the server side RESTful API is in ../server/main.ts.

== Server Address ==
https://np-p.net/

The website servers two purposes:
 (1) Admin Portal: when visited using a browser, the website provides a portal to 
     manage patient information, and 
 (2) RESTful API for mobile clients: under URLs starting with https://np-p.net/api/v1/,
     the website provides the API for mobile clients to query and post data.

== Security ==
The website is encrypted via SSL and protected by a password (username: a, password: b). 
A very short password is used because it is only intended to prevent casual internet 
users from seeing the initial web page, and importantly additional authentication is required
to use either of the two functions above.  If necessary, a longer password may be used 
to add additional security.

== API Entry Points ==
All APIs entry points start with the following URL prefix:
https://np-p.net/api/v1/

The following is a list of current API URLs:

* List subjects:
      https://np-p.net/api/v1/subjects

* List details of a subject (replace ":id" with "email:password"):
      https://np-p.net/api/v1/subjects/:id
  This URL is mainly for testing and will be disabled in production.

* List studies:
      https://np-p.net/api/v1/studies

* List details of a study (replace ":id" with study ID):
      https://np-p.net/api/v1/studies/:id
      
* List "study flows":
      https://np-p.net/api/v1/studyflows
      
* List details of a "study flow" (replace ":id" with study flow ID):
      https://np-p.net/api/v1/studyflows/:id
      
* List patient responses (GET):
      https://np-p.net/api/v1/patient_responses

* List patient responses (POST):
      https://np-p.net/api/v1/patient_responses

  The POST request may provide the following additional parameters:
            studyflow_id
            event_id
            subject_email
            response_text
            response_ID
            curReasonID
            indicated_status
            est_arrival
            submit_time
            additional_response

* List all patient responses for one event (replace ":event_id" with the event ID):
      https://np-p.net/api/v1/patient_responses/:event_id

* List the latest patient responses for one event (replace ":event_id" with the event ID):
      https://np-p.net/api/v1/patient_responses/:event_id/latest

* List events:
      https://np-p.net/api/v1/events

* List details of one event:
      https://np-p.net/api/v1/events/:id
  ":id" takes the format  "KEY:VALUE". The possibilities are:
  (1) KEY = "subject_id", VALUE = the subject ID
  (1) KEY = "subject_email", VALUE = the subject email
  (1) KEY = "event_id", VALUE = the event ID

* Email verification. When a subject is registered, the system may send her a verification
  email.  A link would be provided in the email for the user to click and verify her
  address.  The link's format is (replace ":id" with the subject email):
      https://np-p.net/api/v1/verifyEmail/:id

* Link to request an email for resetting password (replace ":id" with the subject email):
      https://np-p.net/api/v1/resetPassword/:id

* Update password (replace ":id" with the subject email, ":oldpass" with the old password,
  and ":newpass" with the new one):
      https://np-p.net/api/v1/updatePassword/:id/:oldpass/:newpass

* (GET) List messages sent to or received from a subject (replace ":email" with the subject's email,
  and ":since" with the number of seconds since 00:00:00 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC),

* (POST) Send message (replace ":email" with the subject's email; note the email is only used as an ID for the subject):
      https://np-p.net/api/v1/subjects/:email/messages/send
  The POST request should provide the following parameters:
            is_to_patient  // 1 if the message is from admin to the subject; 0 otherwise
            epoch          // Time of the message represented by the number of seconds 
                           // since 00:00:00 UTC, 1/1/1970
            content        // text of the message
